      <a>
        Hello, nice to meet you here. Let me Introduce my self, Iam Angg or
        mostly know as Renix at social social-media. I start my journey as
        artist from elementary school, Iam become an artist because I see my
        teacher before, but after time to time I found other person or should I
        say many person that really have a good art, and that thing make me want
        to improve, but mostly I make art just for fun because why make it if we
        not enjoy it, right? Ok so move on, I have a dream to make an art
        gallery, simply its a art museum with high technology. Why need high
        technology? I want to make it stay till long time, technology improve
        everytime, and what we become if we not follow the improvement. I focus
        to make an anime, cartoon, or game art. I hope my art could spread joy.
      </a>
      <a>
        Why I make ART GALLERY? its simple, I want people to enjoy seeing my art
        through websites not just from social media that the art is separated
        each other, with this in one gallery they can see all my art from time
        to time without open multiple app, And I make this gallery as a first
        step for art museum at future.
